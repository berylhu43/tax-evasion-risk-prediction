# Tax Evasion Detection with Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to identify companies with a higher probability of default or tax evasion using three classification models:

- Linear Probability Model (LPM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

The evaluation uses cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curves to compare predictive power and error rates, with a focus on minimizing false negatives (i.e., companies that actually cheat but are predicted as non-cheaters).

The dataset contains 11 variables with the following definitions

| Variable      | Definition                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk          | 1 if firm found to have evaded taxes after audit; 0 otherwise             |
| Sector        | Historical risk score for the industry sector of a firm                    |
| PARA A        | Discrepancy found in planned expenditure (in crore)                        |
| Risk A        | Risk score computed from Para A and firm traits                            |
| PARA B        | Discrepancy found in unplanned expenditure (in crore)                      |
| Risk B        | Risk score computed from Para B and firm traits                            |
| Money Value   | Firm revenue in past 2 years                                               |
| Risk D        | Risk score computed from some firm traits                                  |
| Score         | Comprehensive risk score                                                   |
| Inherent Risk | Firm's historical risk score                                               |
| Audit Risk    | Total discrepancy score computed from examining firm tax returns           |



## üìä Key Findings

- **Linear Probability Model (LPM)**  
  - Threshold 0.5: Error rate = 9.5%, False Negative Rate = 18.24%  
  - Threshold 0.6: Error rate = 11.08%, False Negative Rate = 24.53%

- **KNN Model (Best Performance)**
  - Without Standard Scaler: Error rate = 5.7%, FNR = 9.43%
  - With Standard Scaler: Error rate = 3.6%, FNR = 6.92%
  - Optimal K = 1

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Error rate = 3.86%, False Negative Rate = 4.3%

## üîç Model Selection

We chose **KNN with K=1 and standard scaling** for its superior performance. Logistic regression also performed well and provides interpretability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

The data only contains **audited firms**, introducing **selection bias**. Models may not generalize well to unaudited companies or detect emerging fraud patterns.
